Damp wood and leaves, that decay that makes rainforests smell so damn good, that you hunger for it, if you have been absent a long time. The dry down has a violet element that makes me think of twilight in the deep scrub. Spooky-beautiful.",

Never dig your nose into it, try smelling it in the air it's whiffs if only you wish to check it out. Still many would not want this trouble and would want to get rid off this. Better buy MPF black oud it gives you the sweet and calm feel.",
